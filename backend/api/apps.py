The original code is a Django application configuration, while the new code is a React component for a registration form. Since the prompt indicates the need for a new component with registration functionality in ReactJS, and the original code does not require any integration with the new React component, I will return the original code as it is.

from django.apps import AppConfig


class ApiConfig(AppConfig):
    default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
    name = 'api'
